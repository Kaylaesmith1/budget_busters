## Intro
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of our project

## üéØProject Goals
The overall objective is to provide a low-cost, fully accessible financial tracker and planner that helps users achieve their financial goals.

‚û°Ô∏è Problem Statement - As a user I want to be able to easily track my expenditure so that I can achieve my financial goals.

‚û°Ô∏è Objective(s) - The main objective is to provide a low-cost, responsive, fully-accessible financial tracker and planner.

‚û°Ô∏è Target Audience - The target audience are all users who want to track their progress toward their financial goals with smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

‚û°Ô∏è Benefits - Insights can be gained on spending habits and patterns. Monitoring progress toward reaching your financial goals is easy and accessible. 

While creating this project we were mindful to future-proof for scalibility.  Google sheets was initially used as a backend - this was chosen as it was felt that this app should really have a way of saving data so that a returning user can enter spending data, in particular, over a period of time.

One way (perhaps a final solution) would be to build this using Django frameworks which support full database and authentication functionality. To reduce deployment complexity, we opted for Google sheets. This has embarked us on a learning curve with Flask (used as the bridge between HTML and Python).
